# Linear Regression Example in Python

This repository contains a simple Python script demonstrating how to perform linear regression using scikit-learn.

## Overview

The script generates synthetic data with a linear relationship and adds some noise. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance. Finally, it visualizes the results and prints the model's coefficients, as well as an example of predicting a new value.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
